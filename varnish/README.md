=======

Varnish Cache is a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP
reverse proxy. You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and
configure it to cache the contents. Varnish Cache is really, really fast. It
typically speeds up delivery with a factor of 300 - 1000x, depending on your
architecture.
